# Microservice from devops perspective

There are four principals upon which a microservices should be developed.

- Should be _self contained_ and _independently deployable_ .

* Should be _configurable_ (i.e when the instance is start-up , should read its configuration information from a central location)

* Should be _transparent_ to the client, client should talk to service discovery that help in locating the instance.

* Should communicate its _health_
